## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See error states when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` and/or `Email Address` fields are empty
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly
- **Bonus**: See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- **Bonus**: See a custom-styled `select` form control in the sign-up form

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Dart Sass (https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

### What I learned

I really learned a lot with this challenge. Making a custom select field was something I had never done before. The actual styling was simple but making it behave like a select field required a lot of research, trial and error as well as effort. Also learned a lot more about accessibility. Amazing challenge.

### Continued development

I want to keep adding weapons to my arsenal. This was a great one.
